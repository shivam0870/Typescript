Introduction to typescript 

What is it, why do we need it 

A programming language to address shortcomings of Javascript 
Every js file is ts file and js is subset of ts 


Benifits: 
Static typing 
Code completion 
Shorthand notations 
Tow types of programming languages ->   

Statically Typed                         Dynamically Typed 
Ex: C++,C#,Java                         Ex: Javascript, Pyhon, Ruby

int num = 10;                           let number = 10;
num = "a" -> wrong                       number = "a"

Drawbacks ->

Complications 
 
.ts -> Compiler -> .js

Simple Projects -> Javascript and for Medium to large projects will be used to Typescript

Tuples 

It is a fixed length array and each element has a paticular type 
//Used in generally in cases where we use key value pairs or something like that 

let user: [number,string] = [1,'Shivam'];
